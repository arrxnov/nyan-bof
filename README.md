# NYAN-BOF

This project overwrites the target machine's Master Boot Record with the nyan.mbr image built by Brainsmoke. (https://github.com/brainsmoke/nyanmbr)

This will do effectively permanent damage to the target machine and render it unusable. This is mainly built for the trolls at the MWCCDC Regional Red Team who have used it effectively against Linux servers for some time now. I figure they should be allowed to target Windows as well. It is not designed for any serious penetration testing or red teaming exercise as its destructive nature renders it opposite of all good sense. The author does not give consent for this to be used in any context for any reason. It remains only a tool to torment college competition teams after all hope has already been lost.
